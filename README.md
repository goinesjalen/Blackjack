Blackjack Game
This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a bit of Axios to send hand results to a Google Sheet

Description
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos worldwide. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.

In this implementation, players can place bets, hit (receive additional cards), stand (end their turn), double down (double their bet and receive one additional card), and split (if dealt two cards of the same rank). The dealer follows a fixed set of rules for drawing cards. The dealer stands on a hard 17 and hits on a soft 17.
